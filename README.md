# Softmax-Regression

Trained a 2-layer softmax neural network to classify images of fashion items (10 different classes, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, etc.) from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The input to the network is a 28 ×28-pixel image (converted into a 784-dimensional vector); the output will be a vector of 10 probabilities (one for each class).
The Fashion MNIST dataset can be downloaded from the following web links:
